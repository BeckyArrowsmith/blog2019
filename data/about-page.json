{"title":"About","slug":"about","content":"Iâ€™ve been obsessed with technology and building things all my life. I feel very lucky to do what is essentially my #1 hobby for a living.\n\nI graduated from a BSc in Web Development from MMU in 2015 and joined Co-op Digital. I was doing design and front-end until 2017, then joined the engineering team learning Python and Django.\n\nTalking at Wills end of beta show and tell\n\nIâ€™ve had a lot of weird tech jobs in my life but those are for another blog post. For now, Iâ€™ll just ramble about what Iâ€™ve got up to at Co-op Digital so far:\n\n    Iâ€™ve worked on our â€˜pattern labâ€™ Alpha, essentially digitising the new brand that went out in 2016. This eventually became the Design Manual\n\n    I built the front-end of the Wills service and some of my components ended up in the design manual to be used across the Co-op digital portfolio\n\n    I wrote our accessibility guidelines\n\n    I do talks for various schools and codeclubs around Manchester\n\n    I help to organise an accessibility meet-up, Open, with some colleagues\n\n    I was part of the Co-op team at HackManchester and came 2nd\n\n    I moved over from the design & front-end team and started learning Python & Django on a legit award winning team inside Co-ops Funeralcare business in 2017. Never thought Iâ€™d win a trophy (well, 2 actually) in this world\n\nIâ€™m now (February 2018) in the Co-op Digital Publishing Services team where weâ€™re creating a product/process for people across the entire Co-op business to publish web content efficiently and effectively. First time Iâ€™ve worked in a Full Stack capacity on a team, I do all sorts!\n\nI consider myself a lifelong learner and anything tech fascinates me. I adore my craft and although I feel like I know literally nothing sometimes due to not being in this world long, Iâ€™m always learning. LEARN ALL THE THINGGGGSSS!\nOutside of work\n\nI love cycling and have built myself a Fixed Gear and a Road bike from scratch. Iâ€™m a tiny human and well, like building things. None of the off the peg bikes really fit me so occasionally Iâ€™ll casually turn my flat into a workshop. Iâ€™d love to get a custom frame made up one day.\n\nI also play guitar and bass. I played bass in a few bands back in the day but I mostly play guitar now. Coincidentally I also built a Partscaster.\n\nIâ€™m also an avid PC gamer and used to play Counter-Strike semi-professionally back in the day ðŸ˜…. You guessed it, I build my own computers too.\n\nIâ€™m also very passionate about the environment & animal rights.","dateLastEdited":"2019-10-29T00:00+01:00"}
