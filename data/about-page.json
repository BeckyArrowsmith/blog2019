I work for [@Co-op Digital](http://twitter.com/coopdigital).\n\nI graduated with a BSc in Web Development from MMU in 2015.\n\nI started off in tech doing design and Front-end but these days I'm writing mostly Python and Node. At work, I tend to look after our Django based products but I'm increasingly finding myself working with APIs and the serverless paradigm. I also look after our Software Engineering apprentices.\n\nOutside of work I'm very much a lifelong learner and always have a side project on the go. At the moment, I'm into APIs and  flexing my front-end chops playing with React/NextJS - hence me building this blogging system from scratch for no apparent reason. I also love Raspberry Pi and random Make projects.\n\nI help to run [Open](http://twitter.com/openmcr) which is an accessibility meetup that's on hiatus right now, I want to get this going again soon. I'm also getting into the concept of \"citizen science\". I want to help enable others to use technology to benefit their communities. For example, hacking together a pollution monitor and sharing that data. \n\nWhen I'm not writing code and tinkering, I love cycling, the great outdoors and video games.\n\n![doing a talk](//images.ctfassets.net/rbg3jyy5o9f7/3GJX4J5QDjUVhGoX11L4Qq/1938087f7542420ea699931b762af5e6/doing_a_talk.jpg)","dateLastEdited":"2019-10-25T00:00+01:00"}}]
